## Predicting multiple-planet systems for TESS

In 2017, TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) will launch, marking a transition from the wide-apertured, long-staring capabilities of Kepler to the sweeping gaze of a new mission able to capture much more of the sky, at the expense of resolution and longer-period planet discoveries. While TESS will hand to astronomers many new objects of interest, its smaller aperture and lack of a fixed stare means it is less likely to come upon planets with smaller radii and periods more than half of its gaze duration, ie. approximately 13.7 days.
