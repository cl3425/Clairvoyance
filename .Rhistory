* From the top graph:
Clearly "debt for students who didn't finish loans" (with median around $10000) are about half of the median debt for thos who did (around $20000).
In both cases, students in Private schools would face more debt than those in Public schools, again, probably due to the higher tuition. Proprietary institutions on the other hand, have the lowest median debt for those who did not finish the aid, but have the highest debt for those who did among all three types of schools.
* Move to the bottom graph. As we can see, the defaut rate on loans for private schools are lowest (about5%) and the completion rate are highest (over 50%) among all three types. While on the other hand, Proprietary Schools tends to have the largest default rate (over 10%) and smallest complete rate (about 40%). That should be something to consider when choosing between those two types of schools.
#Interactive Map
In order to help students find the right school, we created an interactive map which allows users to search for school based on the location and some other key attributes. How to use this map:
* First: You could choose from "Basic map" or "Satellite map", The basic map will provide you the detail address and the satllite map will show you the real scene of the locations.
* Next: Based on your location preference zoom in the map or click the icon with number (the number represent the number of schools within this area.)
* Then: Since there probably still be many schools, you could choose by other contributes (for example: Pell Grant or Graduation rate). Just select the field you are intereted in on the right side bar. You'll see there are small colorful circles-
the bigger size of the circles represent larger number in this field. For example, if I want to find schools based on graduation rate, I can select that field, zoom in to the area and click the bigger sized circle to view.
* You could also choose from the school types: We use labels(college hat) with three color to represent three different type of schools :
+ Blue :  Public Schools
+ Orange: Private-Nonprofit Schools
+ Purple : Proprietary Schools.
Once you click on indivadual schools, it will give you the infomation about school's name, type, Pell Average Disbursement and so on.
Take Columbia University for example:
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="float:center;width: 300px;">
<IMG SRC="columbia.png" ALT="image" width="500px" border = "2">
</span>
</div>
We can see that: The average Pell disbursment in Columbia is about $2549.31, and our graduation rate is about 93% with only 1.9% loan default rate on average.
Now enjoy your search!
